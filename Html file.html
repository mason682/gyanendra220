<h3>Review</h3>
<P title="About Avengers:Endgame">Avengers: Endgame, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is a spectacular conclusion to over a decade of 
Marvel Cinematic Universe storytelling. Released in 2019, the film picks up after the devastating events 
of Infinity War, where the villain Thanos has wiped out half of all life. The remaining Avengers, including
Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), and Thor (Chris Hemsworth), embark on a daring
mission to travel back in time to collect the Infinity Stones and undo Thanos's catastrophic actions. This 
quest is both thrilling and deeply emotional, offering a fitting resolution to numerous character arcs and 
storylines that have unfolded over the years.</P>
<P title="About Avengers:Endgame">The film excels in its ensemble performances, particularly from Downey Jr. and Evans, who deliver powerful
portrayals of their iconic characters. The Russo Brothers’ direction and the screenplay by Christopher Markus
and Stephen McFeely skillfully balance action, humor, and emotional depth, creating a satisfying and poignant
finale. Visually stunning with groundbreaking special effects, Endgame not only serves as a grand spectacle but 
also reflects on themes of sacrifice and redemption, leaving a lasting impact on both fans and the broader cinematic landscape.</p>
